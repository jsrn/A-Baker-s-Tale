This is A Baker's Tale, my first real foray into game development. At the time of writing, it's safe to say I don't really have any idea what I'm doing. The codebase is going to be subjected to frequent, drastic changes as I learn new and better ways of doing things.

I started this project almost a year ago, but it didn't get far before being left to gather dust.

The end result should hopefully be a functioning top down RPG in the style of FF1-6.

Current objectives:

Walking animation/sprites for player character
- [ ] Map transitions
- [ ] Item interaction
- [ ] Event scripting
